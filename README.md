# Hi, I'm Guru!

My name is Guru Gunaratnam, I have been doing system admiministration, web and software development for a number of years.  Current interests are in Typography & Design, Data Pipelines, Full-Stack Javascript Development (Node/Deno) and DevOps.  This is my personal (secondary) repository - repos here are not active and are snapshots of private repos.  The main purpose of this account is as a portfolio to highlight past projects.
